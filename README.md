# SecureCI

## Automated DevSecOps Security Scanner

SecureCI is a local DevSecOps security scanning tool designed to help developers identify common security issues in software repositories.

SecureCI can scan a public GitHub repository, analyze its files and dependencies, generate a vulnerability report, and display the results through a local web dashboard.

The developer reviews the reported vulnerabilities, fixes them manually, and can run a RESCAN to verify whether the issues have been resolved.

SecureCI does not automatically modify or fix source code.
